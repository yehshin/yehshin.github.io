			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>During October 2017, I was couch surfing in NYC so I could work at my first design job. During this time, I needed to Venmo many people to pay rent. After a while, I noticed frictions in the app that I thought would be a great opportunity for me to practice designing solutions for.</p>

			<h2>The results</h2>
			<p>There’s no meaningful outcome as this is an ongoing side project.</p>
			<br>
			<p>However, I did practice running user interviews as I conducted several of them with my friends. I also familiarized myself working with design constraints as I worked off of Venmo's <a class="inline__link" href="https://venmo.com/about/brand/#guidelines" target="_blank">style guide</a>.</p>

			<h2>Everyone's got a group</h2>
			<p>When I presented the idea of Venmo Groups to people, it was understood almost immediately. People resonated with the fact that they go out with pretty much the same people over and over again.</p>
			<br>
			<p>They also mentioned how juggling many recurring payments, such as rent or subscriptions, is tedious to do on Venmo and could be better streamlined.</p>

			<h2>Location, location, location</h2>
			<p>Another issue people had was when they go out with people they don't know, it would be annoying to search for them on the app because they'd have to go around sharing usernames, asking people for their QR codes to scan one by one, etc. People were also anxious about having to request money from people at a later time because they weren't sure if they'd see them again.</p>
			<br>
			<p>With Venmo Groups, you could search for people by location. You could search for nearby users and compile a list of them; think of bluetooth or AirDrop. This makes it easier and faster to find groups of people for the first time. You can also create groups manually.</p>

			<p class="single">With the group concept, you can pay or request funds with multiple people in a single go. This makes it easier than having to repeatedly search for the same group of people each time.</p>

			<p class="single">I really enjoyed working on this project as it was one of my first ones and also because I was able to learn <a class="inline__link" href="https://origami.design/" target="_blank">Origami</a>, the first prototyping tool I ever used.</p>
