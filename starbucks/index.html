			<p class="project-name">Starbucks <span class="project-name-thin">- Mobile App Redesign</span></p>

			<h2 class="text-title">Introduction</h2>
			<p class="text">Like many others, I drink coffee more than I drink water. Living in New York City, Starbucks became a regular for me just because there is about ten of them every block. I was made aware that you could get rewards for using their mobile app so of course I downloaded it. I realized though, after using it many times, there were certains things about it that I wish could be tweaked. During the summer of 2017, I decided to challenge myself and make those changes.</p>

			<h2 class="text-title">Constraints and Assumptions</h2>
			<p class="text">There are several assumptions I needed to make while redesigning the app.</p>

			<p class="text-title-small">Assumptions</p>
			<ol class="lists">
				<li><span class="list-space">The app is used regularly</span></li>
				<li><span class="list-space">Both ordering via app and in-store scan are used</span></li>
				<li><span class="list-space">A variety of items are ordered as opposed to the same isngle thing every time</span></li>
				<li><span class="list-space">The "music" feature is virtually never used</span></li>
				<li><span class="list-space">People would most likely be in a rush to go somehwere once they made their purchase</span></li>
			</ol>

			<p class="text">While designing around these assumptions, I also took note of the possible constraints that could be encountered.</p>

			<p class="text-title-small">Constraints</p>
			<ol class="lists">
				<li><span class="list-space">No access to an online map</span></li>
				<li><span class="list-space">No access to a credit or debit card</span></li>
				<li><span class="list-space">Complications due to human error (Mixing up an order, out of stock, etc)</span></li>
			</ol>

			<h2 class="text-title">Problems and User Needs</h2>
			<p class="text">There were several problems that I personally found could be improved upon while using the app.</p>

			<p class="text-title-small">Problems</p>
			<ol class="lists">
				<li><span class="list-space">The main navigation was not within comfortable reach</span></li>
				<li><span class="list-space">Confirmations from actions were not clear if they executed or not</span></li>
				<li><span class="list-space">There was redundancy when selecting a store location</span></li>
				<li><span class="list-space">Uncertainty in how far along in the ordering process and what to expect from the next screen</span></li>
			</ol>

			<p class="text">I discovered several user needs that stemmed from these problems. One of these needs is the ability to use the application mindlessly. The interface should become routine enough to use without having to fidget with the interface. A user-case when this is benefical is the busy worker ordering a few minutes before arriving to the location on their way to work. It would be frustrating if they had to stop and actually examine the screen longer than they have to and end up taking so long that they might have as well ordered in the store. Another user need is the ability to check the status of their order. I think it would be helpful to see if your order is ready or not while you are waiting or on the way to the store in order to gauge your travel time.  </p>

			<h2 class="text-title">Exploration and Solutions</h2>
			<p class="text">Since this was a redesign, I kept some of the components that I really liked while changing up the ones that I thought would help better improve on the pain points I found.</p>

			<p class="text-title-small">Hot Spot Navigating</p>
			<p class="text collapse">The current design has the nav bar at the top, making it hard to easily reach with your thumb. A solution to this is to simply move the nav bar to the bottom. This is a popular design that most current apps use because it is easy for people to quickly switch between different places. This will help provide less user friction as well as develop the “mindless” use that I want to advocate.</p>

		</div>



		<div class="container collapse-top">

			<p class="text">This also allows for quicker and direct access to the most commonly used functions of the app, such as scanning to pay as well as reloading the amount on the card.</p>

		</div>



		<div class="wide-row wide-row-2">
			
			<img class="image-row" src="../assets/images/starbucks/starbucks-row-2.jpg" width="1440" height="500">

		</div>



		<div class="container">

			<p class="text-title-small">Confidence</p>
			<p class="text collapse">When using the application, there is uncertainty that the purpose of certain buttons propose due to both the ambiguity of the wording. For example, when it says “save” after customizing a drink, does it mean saving it as a favorite or saving it for the current order? There is also uncertainty in terms of where one is in the entire ordering process. Could be thought of as “are we there yet?” </p>
			<p class="text">My solution to this was to set up a wizard-like system so people are more aware of where they are in the ordering process. The current design has a flow where it switches back and forth between screens, disrupting the continuity of a forward-moving ordering process. I also implemented modals in place of screens going back and forth so it maintains the streamline flow. This helps maintain user confidence that their order is moving along.</p>

		<div class="wide-row wide-row-3">
			
			<img class="image-row" src="../assets/images/starbucks/starbucks-row-3.jpg" width="1440" height="500">

		</div>



		<div class="container collapse-top">

			<p class="text-title-small">Eliminate Redundancy</p>
			<p class="text collapse">The store selection process of ordering had a redundancy problem that made me do a double-take to make sure my order processed correctly.</p>
			<p class="text">When you start your order, the app tracks your location and displays the nearest store to you at the bottom of the screen, assuming that is where you'll go. If the tracking did it's job and assumed right, there is no reason to change the location that is prompted. However, if you do not opt to change the location and go to checkout your order, you end up being redirected to a completely new store location screen again, resulting in confusion and redundancy. This also makes you question if any of your choices were correctly processed.</p>

		<div class="wide-row wide-row-4">
			
			<img class="image-row" src="../assets/images/starbucks/starbucks-row-4.jpg" width="1440" height="500">

		</div>



		<div class="container collapse-top">

			<p class="text">My solution for this was to have the store selection as a first step, rather than being fixed at the bottom. This accomplishes two things. It helps people see right away which items are in and out of stock at certain stores. It would be frustrating to have an order all prepared, only to get to the store location and realize the nearest one is out of what was created. It also gives store location the proper focus by making it into a step rather than being a fixed constant, establishing better focus on each step of the ordering process.</p>

		<div class="container">

			<p class="text-title-small">Polished Flow</p>
			<p class="text collapse">My goal with this redesign was to make the flow more concise and clear. This is an example of what an mobile order can look like.</p>

			<h2 class="text-title">Conclusion and Lessons Learned</h2>
			<p class="text">This project was done during the summer of 2017. The cool thing is that, since then, the Starbucks team did actually end up updating the user flow by clarifying the location redundancy with a modal, which was a solution that was along the lines of my redesign.</p>

			<p class="text-title-small">Design for Later</p>
			<p class="text collapse">One facet that I care about when designing products is the longevity of it. Of course I care about the given problem that is discovered, but I also think about how the proposed solution will affect the product's use over time. Could be six months, a year, to even five years from now. If I’m feeling adventurous, maybe even a decade. I actually went on a coffee hiatus because I was drinking way too much, so when I started recently drinking it again and discovered the update stated above, it was a very affirming moment for me.</p>

			<p class="text-title-small">Reason for Everything</p>
			<p class="text collapse">I think every redesign should be taken with a grain of salt, especially if it’s done by one person. The current application is done by a great team that spend their days figuring out how to make it better for everyone. This project was more of a learning challenge for me and I would have to take a guess that if it were to actually ship, the reviews in the app store would go down.</p>

			<p class="text">However, it did teach me to think about why products are designed the way they are. It helped me to put myself in other designer’s shoes and think about what their process was when designing it. What constraints did they face? What was their timeline? What features took priority? Thanks to this project, it helped me to become more receptive and develop a keener sense in the “why” of design.</p>

			<p class="thanks">Thanks for reading!</p>
