			</div>

			<p class="headers">Purpose</p>
			<p class="text">I drink coffee by the gallon. The sweet, magic elixir keeps me going throughout the day. Starbucks was my place to go when I needed caffeine. I was told about the rewards you can earn if you use their mobile app so of course I decided to become a member. However, my experience ordering with the app was not as pleasant and smooth as I thought it could have been.</p>

			<p class="headers">Problems</p>
			<p class="text">Here are the problems I encountered when trying to order with the mobile app:</p>
			<br>	
			<p class="problems">The navigation was positioned uncomfortably.</p>	
			<p class="problems">There was uncertainty when making selections (was this button going to confirm my purchase or save my drink, etc.)</p>	
			<p class="problems">There was redundancy with selecting a store location.</p>	
			<p class="problems">Your sense of knowing where you were in the ordering process was not completely clear (am I almost done, how much more left before I can checkout, etc.)</p>
			<br>
			<p class="text">Wanting to see if I can improve both the interface and experience, I decided to redesign the app in such a way that would solve the issues I had with it. Here's what I came up with.</p>

			<p class="headers">Familiar navigation</p>
			<p class="text">The current design has the navigation menu at the top, making it hard to naturally reach with your thumb.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="text">I decided to go with the navigation at the bottom because most current and popular apps maintain the same form of navigation. This will allow for less user friction and smoother transitions when switching between different apps.</p>

			<img class="starbucks-comparison" src="../images/starbucks/comparison.png" width="1920" height="1080" alt="Image of Starbucks App Comparison">

			<p class="text">This also provides for quicker and direct access to the most commonly used functions of the app, such as scanning with your phone and reloading your card.</p>

			</div>

			<p class="headers">Confidence</p>
			<p class="text">When using the application, I wasn't sure where a certain button would lead me due to both the ambiguity of the wording (for example, when the button says "save" after I customized a drink, did it mean saving it as a favorite or saving the selections I made) and the uncertainty of where I was at all during the ordering process.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="text">My solution to this was to set up a visual, wizard-like system so people know exactly where they are in the process. The current design switches between screens when making edits, which I found to disrupt the continuous ordering process, so I opted for modals instead. The modals are used for both making edits and to also provide confirmation when you do something. This communicates clarity and provides for a smoother process.</p>

			</div>

			<p class="text">I also intentionally made sure the visual timeline was circular. I was concerned with how I would design a wizard-like system on a screen that has such small real estate without it seeming obtrusive. I realized that circular would be the way to go because that format is used in most social media apps as stories. Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat all maintain this circular format and its something people see everyday. That way, when they see this timeline, they will be conditioned to seeing it and it won't seem like a foreign format, resulting in being visually easy on the eye even though the purpose of it might be completely different.</p>

			<p class="headers">Eliminate redundancy</p>
			<p class="text">One part of the app that felt like it interrupted the flow was the store selection. The store selection was located at the bottom of the screen throughout the entire ordering process. While this may sound convenient, there was a problem with redundancy.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="text">When you start your order, the app tracks your location and displays the nearest store to you assuming that is where you'll go. If the tracking did it's job and assumed right, there is no reason to change the location that is prompted. However, if you do not opt to change the location and go to checkout your order, you are actually redirected to a completely new store location screen again, resulting in confusion and redundancy. This also makes you question if any of your choices were correctly processed.</p>

				<img class="starbucks-img" src="../images/starbucks/location-2.png" width="375" height="667" alt="Image of Starbucks Redesign">			

			</div>

			<p class="text">My solution was to have the store location be the first part of the ordering process. This accomplishes two things. It allows people to see which items are in or out of stock right away. Imagine if you decide to select the location at the last step after creating your drink, only to find out it was not in stock. It would be a frustrating waste of time. Another benefit from having it at the beginning is that each step of the process gets its own screen, including store selection, versus being cramped in one. This allows for more clarity and allows people to focus on the right thing at the right time.</p>

			</div>

			<p class="headers">Polished flow</p>
			<p class="text">With my redesign, I believe since the ordering process is divided evenly and clearly, the more you use the app the more mindlessly you will be able to use it. Faster process, faster time you can be sipping on magic elixir.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="text">This is an example of what a complete order would look like!</p>

				<video class="starbucks-vid" autoplay loop>
					<source src="../images/starbucks/starbucks-all.mp4">
				</video>

			</div>

			<p class="headers">What I would have done differently</p>
			<p class="text">There are several aspects of the redesign that I would have done differently if I gave myself more time.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="text">I would start by keeping the gift and music function. I went on my own judgement that nobody was using the Starbucks app to listen to music, but I can't say that for certain. Same with the gift card function.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="text">I would have also highlighted the remaining number of stars left better so it stands out a little more.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="text">Lastly, I would remove the buttons on the modals that are used for confirmation, such as your order has been added to your cart. Instead, I would have them timed to dissappear after a couple seconds to reduce the number of times you have to interact with your phone during your order.</p>
			<p class="text bye">Thanks for reading! Hope your days are sunny and caffeinated.</p>
