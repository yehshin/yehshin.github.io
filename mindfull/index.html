			<p class="project-type">Personal Project</p>

			<p class="project-name">Mindfull <span class="project-name-thin">- Mobile App Concept</span></p>

			<h2 class="text-title">Introduction</h2>
			<p class="text">Combining both my passion for design and desire to help further better the current mental health realm, I decided to do a project that could potentially solve certain recurring problems that come with battling for a more healthy mental life. Most of my design inspiration is thanks to <a class="inline-link" href="https://www.headspace.com/" target="_blank">Headspace</a> and the wonderful goal the team has.</p>

			<h2 class="text-title">User Research</h2>
			<p class="text">With personal encounters through friends and family along with online research, I was able to gather enough data and perspective that allowed me to have a solid enough grasp to have some statistical guidance.</p>

		</div>

		<div class="wide-row wide-row-1 collapse-bottom">

			<img class="user-research" src="../assets/images/mindfull/data.jpg" width="676" height="433" alt="User research data for Mindfull">

		</div>	

		<div class="container">

			<p class="text">I found out that, though the number of people going through some form of mental health issues are increasing, the amount of people actively seeking help is decreasing. This is due to several factors that are listed later. The amount of people seeking personal help also matters heavily on the method in which the help is sought out. This ranges from people’s inner-circles, professionals, annonymously, and more.</p>

			<h2 class="text-title">Constraints and Assumptions</h2>
			<p class="text">There are several assumptions I needed to preface while working on this project.</p>

			<p class="text-title-small">Assumptions</p>
			<ol class="lists">
				<li><span class="list-space">People are willingly seeking out medical health on their own accord.</span></li>
				<li><span class="list-space">To a degree, can stick to a schedule and not end up falling out of it instantly.</span></li>
				<li><span class="list-space">Has at least a few people they can consider friends or close enough to want to contact on this 	personal issue.</span></li>
				<li><span class="list-space">They have steady internet access along with a recent smartphone model.</span></li>
			</ol>

			<p class="text">Considering these assumptions, I needed to then figure out what sort of constraints I was working with. These constraints range from conceptual relationships to engineering blocks.</p>

			<p class="text-title-small">Constraints</p>
			<ol class="lists">
				<li><span class="list-space">People will be limited to using their phones as their mental health reliance.</span></li>
				<li><span class="list-space">Not everyone who suffers with mental health issues might know exactly what their condition is.</span></li>
				<li><span class="list-space">People would need to have a place that is relatively quiet for a duration of time.</span></li>
				<li><span class="list-space">For the meditation portion, it is only voiced by one person so people would have to be okay with his or 	her voice.</span></li>
				<li><span class="list-space">For the sake of simplicity and time for the project, the voice would be in english only, restricting other 	languages.</span></li>
			</ol>

			<h2 class="text-title">Problems and User Needs</h2>
			<p class="text">Mental health has such a large net of issues to tackle, so I decided to focus on physical harm and the longevity of relief. Through the research and personal experiences I endured, I pinpointed these problems.</p>

			<p class="text-title-small">Problems</p>
			<ol class="lists">
				<li><span class="list-space">People feel pressured and restricted from openly talking about their mental health due to negative 	social stigmas.</span></li>
				<li><span class="list-space">People lack an accountability system when it comes to self-care.</span></li>
				<li><span class="list-space">Lack of accountability leads to dangerous, distorted introspection.</span></li>
				<li><span class="list-space">People feel powerless when going through an anxiety or panic attack, especially when endured alone.</span></li>
			</ol>

			<p class="text">Along with providing solutions to these problems, I also just wanted to allow people to feel like there is always a constant, reliable option for them to turn to instead of thinking there is nowhere else to turn. This lead to the discovery of more user needs, such as having an affordable solution as well as a solution that is social to an extent, but still private enough that they don’t fear from being targeted by people who may not necessarily understand what they are going through.</p>

			<h2 class="text-title">Explorations and Solutions</h2>
			<p class="text">Starting from sketching to wireframing to high-fidelity prototypes, I was able to brute force design compositions that can help efficiently provide support.</p>

			<p class="text-title-small">Instant Relief v. Long-Term Relief</p>
			<p class="text collapse">During my exploration, I decided on two main categories of relief: meditation and breathing. The reasoning is because the time frame of both pain and relief varies by person, so I wanted to give people the option that best suits their issue. A couple use-case scenarios are if someone is going through an anxiety attack, choosing the “breathing” option would be more beneficial than meditation because it is meant for instant relief. A proven relief method that would be integrated into this feature is the <a class="inline-link" href="http://in8.uk.com/information-resources/7-11-breathing/" target="_blank">7-11 breathing method</a>. Another use-case is if someone is having trouble controlling their anger and want to medidate on it.</p>

			<p class="text-title-small">Reverse Accountability</p>
			<p class="text collapse">While I trying to find out ways as to creating channels for people to reach out to the user when they are going through something, I realized I needed to give the user enough reason to want to break out of their comfort zone and actually take the step of seeking others.</p>
			<p class="text">This requires maintaining a newfound trust and incentive, to which I create an accountability system that is almost reversed in the sense that you are keeping yourself accountable by reaching out to others through a simple reminder that will ask if you want to let people know how you are feeling after finishing a session.</p>

			<p class="text-title-small">Journals</p>
			<p class="text collapse"><a class="inline-link" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/338.full" target="_blank">Studies</a> show that writing can help alleviate both mental and physical pains. With Mindfull, people can create their own journals that allow people to keep track of their thoughts and emotions throughout the day.</p>
			<p class="text">How does this differ from any other app that can take down simple notes? After asking myself this question, I realized that the main edge that I wanted to give Mindfull was the incentive to improve one’s mental health by relational support. This helped me to design a flow that makes sharing a journal entry feel familiar and not feel like they are sending a write-up, but just sharing their own personal thoughts. </p>

			<p class="text-title-small">Reminders</p>
			<p class="text collapse">Not wanting people to experience this journey alone, I created a reminder system. It maintains the basic reminder system that any other reminder would, but a key difference is the ability to set reminders for others. Going back on my goal for communication to be a key channel for growth, I designed a reminder feature where a person can set reminders for others on their own phone so that they can keep their friends accountable to either tell them it is time for their session or just to give words of encouragement.</p>

			<h2 class="text-title">Conclusion and Lessons Learned</h2>
			<p class="text">This particular project was especially fun for me because it allowed me to take the designs from start to finish. It also allowed me to teach myself <a class="inline-link" href="https://origami.design/" target="_blank">Origami</a> which is a blast. I believe there are still many aspects of this project that can be improved upon and I’m looking forward to the day when I can work with a great team to better this. There are also many things I learned from this entire experience.</p>

			<p class="text-title-small">Brute Force with Intent</p>
			<p class="text collapse">I realized that it just ends up being a waste of time to design without any intentionality behind your work. During the beginning of my exploration I had hundreds of different interfaces and user flows. I then decided to ask myself “why are they designed the way they are?” I couldn’t answer most of them. So I went back to the drawing board and made sure that I could answer every question coming from all angles as to why my design looked the way they did.</p>
			<p class="text">I also learned the power of sheer brute forcing your designs. Combining both intentionality with brute force is an approach that seems to produce the best work for me.</p>

			<p class="text-title-small">Feedback is Gold</p>
			<p class="text collapse">Even just asking my one close friend back home in Michigan what he thought about my designs caused me to rethink new things and look at my work differently. I can only imagine how much more indepth, comprehensive, and investigative my work can get when working with a group of brilliant designers.</p>

			<p class="thanks">Thanks for reading!</p>
