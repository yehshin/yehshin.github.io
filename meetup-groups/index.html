			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>During December 2018, I worked on helping redesign the Meetup groups page to help local groups meet new people and do more of what they love. With being one of the highest traffic pages — about 1 million views per month — this project aimed to help organizers and members better manage and access their groups.</p>

			<h2>The results</h2>
			<p>The redesign was less about moving numbers and more about setting up other teams for future success and flexibilities for iterations, which range from creating space for components to unifying patterns.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Nonetheless, the improved IA did help increase RSVP’s by 1%. The new design also received better customer reviews and became the base template for the rest of the design team to work off.</p>
			<br>
			<p>The full rollout went live in January 2019 to 5 million users.</p>

			<h2>Group activity</h2>
			<p>The activeness of a group wasn’t properly communicated with the old design. Too much emphasis on the immediate upcoming event and not enough clarity around the tenure of the group.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Through research, we found that new prospects judged a group by how active it is — the more active the group, the more likely they would join.</p>
			<br>
			<p>With this in mind, we decided to display the number of past and upcoming events to show the history of activity and the present buzz. This allowed members to quickly see if a group has been around for a while, hasn’t gone stale, etc.</p>

			<p class="single">The event card themselves were redesigned by <a class="inline__link" href="https://www.benjamindauer.is/" target="_blank">Benjamin Daur</a> to better display the essentials. My part was to work closely with engineering to see the capabilities and limitations of our then current design system to best fit the ideal card design. We were on a time constraint because Q1 is our busiest season and needed to release a rollout by then.</p>

			<h2>People first</h2>
			<p>Organizing is no small task, and organizers felt they weren’t being given the proper attention they deserve from both credential and logistical standpoints. Organizers wanted to make sure they were easy to reach by members to answer any questions they may have.</p>
			<br>
			<p>To help with this, we moved the layout of the "people components" — organizers and members — to the top right of the page. We also stripped away the card layout as the information displayed was learned to not be essential.</p>
			<br>
			<p>While we weren’t able to implement any smart logic — such as highlighting the most active members, members you’ve been to events with before, etc. — showing the number of members and profile pictures more prominently allowed prospects to immediately gauge if the group is a right fit for them.</p>
