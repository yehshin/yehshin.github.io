				<p class="headers about-top">Who am I</p>
				<p class="text">My name is Ye Heon Shin, but people call me Yay. I'm a recent grad from New York University.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="text">I originally went to NYU to go into law, which is what I studied for the first three years. However, my final year, I switched to design to see what loving your work is like. <span class="dark">It feels amazing.</span></p>
				<br>
				<p class="text">However, I know that's not enough. I'm more than self-aware that I am just starting out and, to be quite honest, pretty behind in terms of both formal education and professional experience.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="text"><span class="dark">But I am more than ready to learn. </span>One of the main aspects that attracted me to design was how much learning I had to do, yet instead of being overwhelmed I was in a constant state of excitement. To be pro-active, I rigorously taught myself the ins & outs of design tools through personal challenges and constant practice. I taught myself the fundamentals of design through research and developed an eye for good design from looking at hundreds of examples everyday. What I really need now is a team to give me the opportunity to be able to let me contribute my current strengths and help improve on my weaknesses so that I can offer more to the team. Right now, I don't know what I don't know, but I do know I want to get better.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="text"><span class="dark">I am currently seeking a design internship</span>, so if I seem like a good fit for your team, please send me an <a class="my-email" href="mailto:yeshin316@gmail.com?Subject=Hello" title="yeshin316@gmail.com">email</a>!</p>

				<p class="headers">Wanna know more? Ok, have some facts</p>

				<p class="text">I was born and raised in Michigan, which is where I also currently reside.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="text">I moved a total of 5 times growing up.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="text">My background is Korean but I've never been to Korea. Fail.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="text">I once ate 200 dumplings in one sitting.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="text">I'm on Netflix in "Bill Nye Saves the World, ep 8". Yes, that's me above in the middle looking extra uncomfortable and yes, that's Karlie Kloss.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="text">I've never broken a bone.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="text">I think dogs are too good for people and deserve unconditional love.</p>
