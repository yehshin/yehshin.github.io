				Hi! My name Ye Heon Shin. In case you were wondering, that is pronounced "yay". Yep, just like the cheer. I am a 21 year old student at New York University and am set to graduate May 2017. Born and raised in Michigan, I came to New York City to escape suburbia. When I started school, I went in with the intentions of going into law. However, I came to realize - a little late, but that's okay - it was not the type of problem solving I wanted to do in life. 
				<br>
				<br>
				I am currently seeking a full-time position as a product designer or developer. Since I am still a student and created all my projects alone, I really desire to be part of a team where I can collaborate and work together to build new things.
