			<h1 class="about-header">About Me</h1>

			<p class="about-text about-text-top">Hey y'all, my name is Ye Heon Shin and I'm a designer with a penchant for all things digital.</p>

			<p class="about-text">People know me by "yay." I recently graduated from New York University and am now living in West Bloomfield, Michigan aka the good ol' mitten. I attended NYU with the intent of going into law, which is what I studied for the first three years. However, during the beginning of my final year I realized I was not doing it for me. Completely starting from scratch again, I had peers that introduced me to design. It was then when I realized what it meant to love what you do.</p>

			<p class="about-text">I strive for my designs to be efficient in every way possible. I also love the subtle aspects about design. I remember watching a documentary on Star Trek (don't worry, Star Wars ftw) and how one of the CGI designers mentioned something about the light effects in the movies. He said, "you don't notice it when it's there, but you notice it when it's not." That really resonated with me and I try to apply that to all my designs, where users will have a seamless experience and be able to get the full use out of it without having to think. My favorite thing though, by far, about design is the constant learning. You can always know more tomorrow than you did today.</p>

			<p class="about-text">I'm currently seeking design opportunities so if I sound like someone that would be a good fit for your team, send me an <a class="contact-links" href="mailto:yeshin316@gmail.com?Subject=Hello" title="yeshin316@gmail.com">email</a>. If you just want to chat that's cool too! Here's my <a class="my-resume" href="../Ye Heon Shin - Resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a>.</p>

			<p class="about-text">Oh yeah, btw, I'm on Netflix in "Bill Nye Saves the World, ep 8" (that's me in the middle smiling really awkwardly)</p>
