			<h1 class="title breathe-title">Breathe - Mobile UX/UI Project</h2>

			<p class="text project-text">Breathe is a personal project I worked on to help aid anxiety attacks or any other form of mental breakdown.</p>
			<p class="text project-text">The project was designed using Sketch and was put together with InVision.</p><br><br>

			<h2>Research</h2>
			<p class="text project-text">I came across some data that explained the 7-11 breathing method, where inhaling for 7 seconds and exhaling for 11 seconds is proven to help calm a person during an anxiety attack or any other from of distress.</p>
			<p class="text project-text">With this information, I decided to design the functionality of the application around this concept.</p>

			<img class="breatheImg breatheImg2" src="../images/breathe/breathe-img2.png" width="375" height="667" alt="Frame 2 for Breathe">
			<img class="breatheImg breatheImg3" src="../images/breathe/breathe-img3.png" width="375" height="667" alt="Frame 3 for Breathe">
			<img class="breatheImg breatheImg4" src="../images/breathe/breathe-img4.png" width="375" height="667" alt="Frame 4 for Breathe">

			<h2>The Design</h2>
			<p class="text project-text">One aspect I really wanted to maintain with Breathe is being very quick to the point. I didn't want any delay in the process of opening the application and had it go straight to the functionality.</p>
			<p class="text project-text">Also interesting to note that a big reason why many people suffer from breathing troubles during an attack is the shock actually makes the person forget to inhale, which is why that's the first directive the user sees when opening the application.</p>
			<p class="text project-text">With a clear CTA (Call to Action), the application is designed to be very easy to use and provide swift aid.</p>
