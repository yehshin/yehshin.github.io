			<h2 id="breathe-title">Breathe - Mobile UX/UI Project</h2>

			<p class="text">Breathe is a mobile application designed to swiftly provide relief in dire physical or psychological breakdowns, such as anxiety attacks.</p>
			<p class="text">The project was designed using Sketch and animated with InVision.</p>

			<h2>The Purpose</h2>
			<p class="text">As someone who has been with people who experienced anxiety attacks first hand, it was scary seeing it happen for the first time. When it happened, I wasn't sure what to do so I just held them really tight. But what if I wasn't there?</p>

			<h2>Research</h2>
			<p class="text">After conducting research, I discovered the 7-11 breathing method, where you inhale for 7 seconds and exhale for 11 seconds. This is proven to help calm the mind and relax body, which can be effective in stablizing a panic attack. However, you are not restricted to those numbers, as long as it gets you into the rhythm of having your exhales longer than your inhales.</p>
			<p class="text">Interesting to note, a common reason why the breathing is so hard during the attack is because the person actually forgets to inhale when it happens, which is why it is the first reminder a user sees when opening the application.</p>

			<h2>What I Want</h2>
			<p class="text">While testing other stress relief applications, I noticed one common factor: it wasn't snappy. When the application is opened, they would ask the user to perform a series of actions ranging from signing in to logging in their current state. Breathe is more focused on being immediately available because attacks can happen within seconds.</p>
			<p class="text last-text">This is why it goes straight into the functionality of helping the user gain control of their breathing. What I want is to make sure no one feels like they are not in control during these attacks.</p>
