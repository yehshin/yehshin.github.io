						<h1>Overview</h1>
						<p>Like many other companies, Betterement started with only a website. Now, with apps popping up left and right, it makes sense to start investing in our own. With a big focus lately and really updating our app, we spent a large focus on building out our first mobile design system.</p>

					</div>

					<div class="content-block">

						<h1>Outcome</h1>
						<p>As design never stops, so do design systems, and we’re constantly iterating. With Flutter being the technology of choice, we have been able to create a robust library of components as well as documentation and rules around the usage to help designers better focus on solving problems as opposed to creating components and help engineers implement components more efficiently.</p>

					<div class="content-block">

						<h1>Problem</h1>
						<p>Every team has their own reasons for implementing a design system; ours were:</p>

						<ol class="project-reasons">
							<li>Mobile app was becoming inconsistent with patterns and implementations, resulting in longer implementation times and disjointed experiences</li>
							<li>With startup timelines, more time was being spent on building components every project as opposed to diving deeper into the problem being solved</li>
							<li>The app felt very different from the desktop version, feeling like two different services even though it’s the same</li>
							<li>With financial management increasingly becoming more mobile friendly, we wanted to make sure future projects and iterations can be done so easily with a flexible foundation</li>
						</ol>

						<h1>How we built a joint checking account</h1>
						<p>We wanted to make it easy for people to create a joint checking account with their partner.</p>
						<p>We allowed customers to easily add someone to their existing checking account, which would mean they would not have to update their billing or need to close out their account, or create a new separate account to be paired with their existing individual account.</p>

						<h1>The system in the design</h1>
						<p>We paired with engineering to make sure that there were guidelines and rules set in place for the usage of components.</p>

						<p>Execution wise, the components had to come first in order to start building out the rules. We paired with engineers to do an audit of the most reused components from the native app and converted those into Flutter components — some where 1:1 translations and some were updated based on if we thought it could be improved.</p>
						<p>Once we had our building blocks, we started pairing that with current layouts in the app and started building out layouts, grids, usage, states, etc. We’d share certain examples and other designers from different squads would share how they’d use the components and we’d try to find the ruling that would be accomodate most use cases.</p>

						<p>We then did the very fun, yet tedious, task of building out all the components into a Figma library. Variants happened to launch so we were able to do some fun stuff with them.</p>
						<p>Once we got that in place, we started writing out the documenation for the components in the Figma pages so when references, other people can know how to use them. The documentation itself is very rough as I think writing documentation is such a hard and important skill, but we’re always working on it to make it better.</p>

						<h1>So how’s it going?</h1>
						<p>Designers have voiced how much easier it is now to create their designs, but also still not feel too constrained and not feel like they can’t get fun with their ideas. Engineers have also voiced how much easier it is to easily implement screens with the components and rules in place. People are working faster and smarter, and it feels good to serve people not just outside of Betterment, but in it as well.</p>
